    <h1>What we Aim</h1>
    <p>
    The second wave of Covid-19 has made deep impacts in the Rural parts of India. And this is the time they need us the most! We are creating a network of <span id="link">organisations</span> that are working on ground. From <span>spreading awareness</span> to curb vaccine hesitancy to <span>providing medicine kits</span> volunteers are working tirelessly. We aim to create a strategy that can customised and adopted by organisations or even individual volunteers on ground.
    We aim to aid these orgainisations on ground by <span>providing medicine kits</span>, and <span>teleMedicine</span> service by connecting doctors on need basis.
